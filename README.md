# Perceptron Algorithm on Placement Dataset
---
- This repo. demonstrates the implementation of the Perceptron algorithm on a real-world dataset — placement.csv.The main goal is to classify or predict outcomes based on features related to student placement, such as academic scores, specialization, or other relevant factors.

##### Why I have created this repository on my GitHub account
- Learning Purpose: As a self-learner on a Data Science journey, this repo. showcases my practical understanding of supervised machine learning and the foundational Perceptron algorithm.
- Model Exploration: The Perceptron is a simple yet powerful algorithm — a key building block for modern deep learning. Implementing it helps solidify core ML concepts like linear classification and weight updates.
- Hands-on Practice: Working with real datasets like this helps bridge the gap between theory and practice.
